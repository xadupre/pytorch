"""
Checkpoint functionality for machine learning models.

This module provides classes for saving and loading model checkpoints in a distributed
training environment. It includes functionality for coordinating checkpoint operations
across multiple processes and customizing the checkpoint process through hooks.

Key components:
- Checkpointer: Main class for orchestrating checkpoint operations (save, load)
- CheckpointWriter: Handles writing state dictionaries to storage
- CheckpointReader: Handles reading state dictionaries from storage read
- Barrier: Synchronization mechanism for distributed checkpointing
- RankInfo: Information about the current rank in a distributed environment
